# Rudra on the Rust Standard Library

This folder documents the tools and instructions on how to analyze the rust
standard library using Rudra.

The process is roughly based on [RalfJung's miri-test-libstd](https://github.com/RalfJung/miri-test-libstd)
and uses `xargo` to build the standard library.

We offer two ways to analyze the standard library:

# Running Through Docker

The easiest way to analyze the standard library with Rudra is under docker.

1. Build the base `rudra` docker image in the top level directory and tag it
   as `rudra`.

2. Build the docker image from this folder: `docker build -t rudra-std .`

3. Run the docker image: `docker run -it rudra-std`

(Note: the run command will output a large number of reports, we recommend
 piping them to a file e.g `docker run -it rudra-std > /tmp/std-report.txt` to
 go through them more easily.)

# Running Manually

Alternatively, you can manually try to follow the steps that Docker will do
automatically for you as follows:

## Pre-requisites

1. Set up `rudra` as per instructions in the main README.

2. `cargo install xargo`

   *Ensure that `xargo` is installed.*

3. `rustup component add rust-src`

   *Make sure that you have the source code for the rust library installed*

## Analyzing

1. Install the modified release or debug version of rudra as per usual with
   `install-debug.sh` or `install-release.sh`

2. Run the `rudra_analyze_std.sh` script **from this folder**. You can pass any
   rudra arguments to this script such as
   `./rudra_analyze_std.sh -Zrudra-disable-panic-safety`.

## I want to analyze a different Rust version

Sure thing, just use the `XARGO_RUST_SRC` variable. For example you can compile
the latest nightly Rust standard library with:

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup +nightly component add rust-src

export XARGO_RUST_SRC=/home/ammar/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library
./rudra_analyze_std.sh
```

## Why xargo?

`xargo` offers the easiest way to actually compile the standard library. While
it is possible to compile the standard library fully from source
(*rust-lang/rust*), their build system is fairly complicated and sets
environment variables and flags internally.

In contrast, `xargo` wraps all this complexity and builds the standard library
for us with just one line. It is far easier to hook for rudra than trying to
compile fully from source.
